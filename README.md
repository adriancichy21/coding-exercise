Coding exercise for SPORTRADAR.

I have implemented a scoreboard via 3 classes:
  1. Team, which keeps name and score;
  2. Match, which keeps match data like homeTeam and awayTeam;
  3. Scoreboard, which implements base functionality of real scoreboard.

Usage of the scoreboard implemented in Main class.

Greetings,
Adrian Cichy
